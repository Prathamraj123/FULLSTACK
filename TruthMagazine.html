3. In the Truth Magazine, Ramakrishnan and his colleagues are engaged in
simplifying English into a more regular language called Speak Simplified. 
The truth magazine it is described that the word can take a variety of 
prefixes to eliminate the need for the massive number of words we have 
in English. For example: 
Any word – could be negatived by adding the affix un-, or could be 
strengthened by the affix plus-, or, for still greater emphasis, doubleplus. 
Thus, for example, uncold meant “warm”, while pluscold and 
doublepluscold meant, respectively, “very cold” and “superlatively 
cold”.
Implement a JavaScript file (SpeakSimplified.js) with three functions 
– exclusion, strengthen and emphasize. The system must take the string 
as input as, prepend the prefixes "un", "plus", and "double" to that string, 
respectively, and return the new string. You can test your implementation 
by loading SpeakSimplified.html into the browser
